            <h1>BEACH RECREATIONAL SUITABILITY</h1>
This project aims to develop a web application that assesses the recreational
suitability of beaches. The application leverages machine learning models trained on
a diverse dataset provided by the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information
Services (INCOIS). By analysing various environmental parameters like wave height,
wind speed, and water temperature, the model predicts the suitability of a beach for
specific recreational activities such as swimming, surfing, and sunbathing. The
website presents this information in a user-friendly format, allowing users to make
informed decisions about their beach outings.
The Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) is a premier
oceanographic institution in India. It provides a wealth of oceanographic data,
including real-time and historical data on various parameters relevant to coastal and
marine activities. For this project, we utilised a dataset provided by INCOIS, which
encompasses:
● Wave Height: The height of ocean waves, a crucial factor for surfing and
other water sports.
● Wind Speed: The speed of wind, which can influence wave patterns and
beach conditions.
● Water Temperature: The temperature of the water, affecting swimming
comfort and marine life.
● Current Speed: The speed of ocean currents, which can impact swimming
safety and water sports.
● Tide Level: The level of the tide, influencing beach accessibility and water
activities.
To ensure the accuracy of the machine learning models, we employed rigorous
validation techniques. Key steps involved:
1. Data Preprocessing: The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed to handle
missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
2. Feature Engineering: Relevant features were extracted from the raw data to
improve model performance.
3. Model Selection and Training: Various machine learning algorithms,
including decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines, were
evaluated. The best-performing model was selected and trained on the
preprocessed data.
The website was developed using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The website allows users to comprehensively see the various parameters of
beaches, this will determine whether the users should go to that place or not. HTMLis used to provide the framework, CSS is used to give style to the format and lastly
JS was used to integrate ML models.
